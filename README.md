# HSCSWeb

HSCSWeb is a HearthStone Card Statistics Website.

This is part of a bigger package which will eventually:
  - Consume Hearthstone Log Files and HSReplay Files
  - Derive statistics about the contained games and game entities
  - Commit those statistics to a community-driven database
  - Allow those statistics to be viewable via the web

Still not sure what we're dealing with? Consider the following card:

**Acolyte of Pain** [EX1_007][Classic][Neutral Minion][3 mana, 1/3]: Whenever this minion takes damage, draw a card. *He trained when he was younger to be an acolyte of joy, but things didn’t work out like he thought they would.*

Imagine if we could analyze some Hearthstone data and produce an output like this (sample):

```
=== Acolyte of Pain ===
Seen 67,252 times in 43,713 games over 5 months.
Phase of Game:
     Average Turn Drawn: 4.12

     Most Damage Dealt in one Game: 8 (by PlayerY in Oct 2015)
     Most Cards Drawn: 8 (by PlayerZ in Oct 2015)
... and so on
```

A Hearthstone Fan could then upload their own statistics and compile their stats for Acolyte of Pain over their 30 games. They would be able to compare their stats side-by-side with the community average and realize:

- Wow, I need to work on more draws with my Acolyte because My average is 1.30 and the community average is 1.72.
- Wow, I need to mulligan for this card harder since my average drawn is 6.15 and the community average is 4.12.
